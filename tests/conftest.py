Test bootstrap for pytest

Ensures the repository root is on sys.path so tests can import
the `custom_components` package (the integration source) during
collection. This is a minimal, temporary shim â€” long-term, tests
should use Home Assistant's test harness fixtures and not rely on
local path hacks.
